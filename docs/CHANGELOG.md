# Changelog

What shipped, newest first. Cross-repo integration changes made on our side are recorded here too.

## Unreleased

- `scripts/pgp_leech.py` downloads consented-public PGP-HMS genotype files into
  `$JUST_VCF_SAMPLES_DIR/pgp-hms/<data type>/<participant>/<download id>/`, with a sorted, resumable
  `manifest.jsonl`. It honours the site's 5 s crawl delay.
- gtars and refget join the core, for VRS allele ids and refget seqcol assembly identity.
- Package skeleton: uv library on hatchling, lean core (polars-bio, pydantic, platformdirs, typer,
  python-dotenv) with `[reference]`, `[liftover]` and `[ancestry]` extras.
- House rules (`CLAUDE.md`, charter, doc set) adopted from the repo ruleset gist, and the consumer
  triage loop adopted from its gist.
