# Dogfooding findings — open

Quirks, bugs and gaps found by using just-vcf on real genomes. Each carries a stable `F#` id and
moves to [PREVIOUS_ISSUES.md](PREVIOUS_ISSUES.md) when resolved here, or to
`<UPSTREAM>_PENDING_FIXES.md` when it needs an upstream change first.

## F1 — Deflate64 zips cannot be opened

Severity: low · Found 2026-09-29 by `scripts/sniff_corpus.py` over the PGP-HMS participants.

One PGP upload (a Veritas VCF of 2.9 GB, zipped by Windows Explorer) uses zip method 9, Deflate64.
The standard library cannot read it, so `sniff` reports `unreadable` and names the method. Reading it
needs a third-party inflater (the `zipfile-deflate64` package, or `7z` as a subprocess) behind an extra.
Not fixed: one file, and the same person's VCF may exist unzipped elsewhere.

**Corrected 2026-10-22.** The member is not a Veritas VCF: read through Info-ZIP `unzip -p` (built
with Deflate64), its header is PGP's own freeBayes+VarScan2 `vcf-merge` on hg19, 2.93 GB unzipped
from 678 MB, a format the loader already reads (`vcf_freebayes_varscan2`). The person has nothing
else on disk but a 23andMe export, so this is their only sequencing callset here. `sniff` already
answers right (`unreadable`, naming the method). Reading it needs a Deflate64 inflater, and each
option is a dependency decision, which is the lead's (§5):

- `zipfile-deflate64` or `inflate64` (a C extension, the one py7zr uses) behind a new extra, opened
  where `sniff` and `open_payload` hit method 9; a new dependency, licence to check;
- `unzip` or `7z` as a subprocess when one is on `PATH`, streaming the member: no Python dependency,
  but a system one, and a subprocess in a library;
- leave it: one file in 1,851.

## F3 — A headerless file holding two exports loses the second one

Severity: low · Found 2026-09-30, same sweep.

One upload (`rsid_table_headerless`) is a 23andMe-shaped export followed by an AncestryDNA-shaped one
(5 columns). The loader keeps the 643,487 four-column rows and drops the 677,437 five-column rows with
a warning, as FORMATS.md predicted. Not fixed: splitting one file into two facets needs a second format
per file, which the loader does not have.

**Measured and surfaced 2026-10-22.** Both halves are one person: of the 164,378 ids both halves call,
164,275 have the same genotype (99.94%), and 166,047 of 166,528 shared ids sit at the same position.
The first line is a stray 5-field row (an empty field between position and genotype, not F2's place),
then 643,487 four-field rows, then 677,436 five-field rows to the end (chromosomes 1–26, `0` for no
call). The load now says so: a file that ends in at least 1,000 rows of one other width gets a warning
that it looks like a second export appended, not read. Still not loaded, and why each repair is wrong:

- *Read the 5-field rows as a second facet in this loader:* the library cannot load that half even as
  its own file (`ancestrydna` needs its header line), so it needs a new headerless two-allele format id
  and a part option in the facet id, for one file whose halves state no vendor. Calling the second half
  AncestryDNA would be the shape standing in for a vendor statement.
- *Split the file into two inputs and load each:* that is routing around the loader (CLAUDE.md §7).

What would close it: a headerless two-allele-column layout in `formats.rsid_tables`, and `load`
returning one facet per layout block of a file (the shape `Loaded` already has for caller splits).
Code of the warning: `loaders/rsid_table.py` `_appended_export`; test
`test_an_appended_export_in_another_layout_is_named_not_read`.

## F17 — Living DNA indel calls need the chip's site alleles for REF

Severity: low · Found 2026-10-22 resolving F4 on the one real Living DNA file.

`resolve_ref` now splits Living DNA's run-together indel genotypes against the reference (F4, in
[PREVIOUS_ISSUES.md](PREVIOUS_ISSUES.md)). Of the 83 rows, 4 get REF and ALT. 54 are split with REF
unread: 38 homozygous calls, where the text shows one of the site's two alleles and so cannot say
whether the site is `CA>C` (the call is hom-ref) or `C>CA` (hom-alt), and 16 hets whose two alleles
both equal the reference over their own spans (an insertion and a deletion fit alike; every het
deletion is one). 25 stay unsplit: 24 fit the reference at several splits (repeats), 1 at none. These
rows cannot be written to a VCF or minted. What would settle them is the site's own two alleles, from
the Sirius chip's manifest (LANDSCAPE: chip manifests), which the library does not read. Why each
repair from the text alone is wrong:

- *Read a homozygous call whose allele equals the reference as hom-ref:* it picks one of two sites the
  text fits, which is the genotype the row is about.
- *Take the shortest allele as REF on a het:* it calls every ambiguous het an insertion.
- *Split a repeat at the anchored point nearest the middle:* it chooses among splits the reference
  fits equally.
