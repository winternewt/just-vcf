# Dogfooding findings — open

Quirks, bugs and gaps found by using just-vcf on real genomes. Each carries a stable `F#` id and
moves to [PREVIOUS_ISSUES.md](PREVIOUS_ISSUES.md) when resolved here, or to
`<UPSTREAM>_PENDING_FIXES.md` when it needs an upstream change first.

## F1 — Deflate64 zips cannot be opened

Severity: low · Found 2026-09-29 by `scripts/sniff_corpus.py` over the PGP-HMS participants.

One PGP upload (a Veritas VCF of 2.9 GB, zipped by Windows Explorer) uses zip method 9, Deflate64.
The standard library cannot read it, so `sniff` reports `unreadable` and names the method. Reading it
needs a third-party inflater (the `zipfile-deflate64` package, or `7z` as a subprocess) behind an extra.
Not fixed: one file, and the same person's VCF may exist unzipped elsewhere.

## F2 — 23andMe rows with a doubled tab are dropped

Severity: low · Found 2026-09-30 by loading the 503 PGP-HMS 23andMe-layout files.

Two 2012–2014 23andMe exports carry rows with an empty field between the rsid and the chromosome
(`rs15842⇥⇥1⇥948921⇥CT`): 14 and 35 rows out of about 960,000. The loader drops them and says so in
`Loaded.warnings`. Not fixed: accepting "exactly one empty field after the id" is a guess about what the
vendor meant, and the rows are few. Revisit if another vendor shows the same shape.

## F3 — A headerless file holding two exports loses the second one

Severity: low · Found 2026-09-30, same sweep.

One upload (`rsid_table_headerless`) is a 23andMe-shaped export followed by an AncestryDNA-shaped one
(5 columns). The loader keeps the 643,487 four-column rows and drops the 677,437 five-column rows with
a warning, as FORMATS.md predicted. Not fixed: splitting one file into two facets needs a second format
per file, which the loader does not have.

## F4 — Living DNA indel genotypes cannot be split

Severity: medium · Found 2026-09-30, same sweep.

Living DNA writes an indel's two allele sequences back to back (`CCA`, and up to 52 letters in one
file). 83 rows in the one real file keep the text in `source_gt` with `gt_alleles` null. Splitting needs
the site's alleles, from a chip manifest or from REF once RM3 reads the sequence.

## F7 — Two VCF shapes `sniff` accepts but the loader cannot read

Severity: low · Found 2026-09-30, same sweep.

A VCF re-saved by a spreadsheet (tab-padded, quoted `"##` lines) and Veritas SV/CNV VCFs whose every
header line carries an extra `#` (`###contig`, `##CHROM`) are recognised as `vcf` but fail with "no
#CHROM line". The Veritas shape could be read by accepting `##CHROM` as the column line; the spreadsheet
one needs its own format id, as `23andme_csv` has. Not fixed: three files.

A third failure in the sweep is a corrupt upload (`gzip -t` fails too), and its error is correct.
